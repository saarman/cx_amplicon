3/14/25 - Troubleshooting 4_bwa_mem perl and slurm scripts 


Something is getting caught up in the perl script at lines 3-32
Tried changing  if ($file =~ m/^(.+)_R[12](?:_001)?\.fastq\.gz$/) {                  

Also tried changing the and to an or 

Nothing worked... getting a blank slurm script

Added a few things to the slrum and perl scripts.
I think maybe the error is with samclip? Not able to module load it - should I reach out to CHPC to see if they vcan help?

Tried to get samclip working but ended up not using because we think it clips too much

Trying a chatgpt recommended option for getting the best alignments extracted from the bam files
Output files 

1. Filtered BAM (removes primers & low-quality reads) bash
sample1_filtered_q30.bam
-Filtered out primer sequences (via grep -v -f "$PRIMER_FILE").
-Removed low-quality alignments (samtools view -bq 30).

2.  Sorted BAM (sorted by MAPQ)
sample1_sorted.bam
-Sorted alignments by MAPQ score (descending order).
-Ensures that highest-quality alignments come first.

3. Final Top 100 BAM (Best 100 Alignments)
sample1_top100.bam
-Contains only the 100 best alignments (sorted by MAPQ).
-Header is preserved to maintain BAM format integrity.


samtools view B002-UT-M07101-240702_S1_L001.bam | cut -f 5 | sort -nr | uniq -c

Interpreting Your MAPQ Distribution
Each line shows the number of reads that have a specific MAPQ score.

Key Observations
Most reads (11,531) have a MAPQ of 60, meaning they are highly confident alignments.

Some reads have MAPQ scores in the 50s and 40s, which are still fairly good but slightly less confident.

There are a small number of reads with MAPQ < 30, meaning they have lower confidence.

The biggest issue: 116,580 reads have MAPQ = 0, which means they are either unaligned or multimapped (low confidence).
